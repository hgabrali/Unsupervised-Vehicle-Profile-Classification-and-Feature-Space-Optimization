## ⚖️ 4. Final Comparative Analysis

The project's final and most critical phase is a comparative discussion that addresses Prospect Auto's core need:

* **Efficacy of Unsupervised Learning:** Detailed assessment of how well the clustering solution performs in distinguishing the three vehicle classes, particularly in the context of the high-dimensional silhouette data.
* **Supervised vs. Unsupervised Paradigm:** A conclusive statement determining which approach—the current unsupervised method or the previously employed supervised method—yields the superior and most reliable classification performance for the Prospect Auto requirement, supported by a comparison of key performance metrics.
